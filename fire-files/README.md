# Fire Files

These files are copied from the [FiRe](https://github.com/trality/fire) repository.

They're intended to be a working reference as we build out our model.

The repository lists a 2022 MIT license, so we should be free to reference and adapt what we need.

We should clean up what we don't need and reference all code we use/modify in the final product.
